        My name is Ivan Mukoed I'm a Front-End Engineer based in Kiev☀️. I
        describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source,
        his pet projects and the web itself. I have 3 years of experience
        working in small companies and freelancing. While working on different
        tasks for different clients, I acquired a lot of useful skills, as well
        as the ability to help your websites reach their maximum potential.
        Whatever you’ve got for me - I’m ready. Contact me now to up your web
        game a whole new level.

        I work to make a better web; one that is fast, easy to use, beautiful,
        accessible to all, and frustration-free. Regardless of your specific
        business requirements, in solving these challenges, you have a great
        chance of finding success online. My main experience is in front-end
        development but I also have a passion for design. Given that producing a
        modern website requires the combination of design, server technology,
        and the layer that users interacts with, I believe having experience in
        both design and development allows for making the most optimal user
        experiences.

        When working I prefer to use modern frontend technologies and
        frameworks, CSS-based (Tailwind, MaterialUI, Bootstrap), JS-based
        (React, Vue, Angular, Next, Nuxt etc) and, of course, the one that help
        me with design (Figma, Photoshop, Unsplash). They help me achieve the
        best result in the shortest amount of time possible.
